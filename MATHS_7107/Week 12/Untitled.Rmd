```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
layout(matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))
ROC_plot(lda.prediction)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
