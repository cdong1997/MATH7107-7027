    "One final remark before we finish this computer exercise: We've used an example from network science/analysis to explore a little more about linear algebra in Python. Network science is just one area of data science (it's actually one of my favourite areas, and where a lot of my research is focused) - you can find many useful tools and packages (like `networkx`) to do network analysis in Python if you are interested. Even so, a lot of the more interesting and advanced methods you might find in those packages still rely on linear algebra, and we know that a good data scientist should understand *how* their tools work (rather than just how to make them work), so it's good to see linear algebra in action here."
